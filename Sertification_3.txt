One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

  }

  for (let i=0; i<num.length; i++) {
    if (num[i] >= 13 && num[i] < 26) {
      res.push(alphabet[num[i] - 13])
    } else if (num[i] < 13) {
      res.push(alphabet[num[i] + 13])
    } else {
      res.push(alphabet[num[i]])
    }
  }
  return res.join('')
