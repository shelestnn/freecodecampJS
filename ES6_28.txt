const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
  let responseFromServer = true;
  makeServerRequest.then(result => {
    if(responseFromServer) {
      resolve("We got the data");
    } else {  
      reject("Data not received");
    }
    console.log(result);
    });  
});
